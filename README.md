Candles & Flames: Animated candles with flames on top of each cake layer.
Text Animations: A sequence of birthday greetings, including a playful "YOOO MY FRIEND!", followed by "Happy Birthday!", "Wish You All The Best!", and ending with "See ya!(─‿─)".
Background & Effects: The background color changes, and smooth fade-in/fade-out effects bring the scene to life.
